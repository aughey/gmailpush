So, you're confused as to why you can get email PUSHed to your mobile phone (iPhone, for example, 
but there are others, of course) or your iPod Touch (in my case) but not your computer (mac, in 
this case). I've got the Google notifier, but that checks the server, by default, every 15 mins (if 
my memory serves me correctly. I've changed that to 5 mins using the hidden preference thing (google
'gmail notifier interval' to find it) but that makes me feel a little rude. IMAP PUSH is the answer,
but the notifiers don't seem to use it. 

This script wasn't written as a replacement for the gmail notifier, but i'll certainly work on it. 
The idea behind this script was to allow for easy modification to use in your projects by looking
at this fairly complete script. If you want it to do something different, you could change the 
self.showNewMailMessages() line in waitForServer() to whatever you want. Perhaps you've got an
Arduino and you want it to light something up as soon as (well about 3-4 seconds later) the message
is sent. A fairly simple example, i know, but you get the idea.

For this script to work, you need to enable IMAP in the GMail settings. Just to make sure you got
that:

			!!! ENABLE IMAP IN YOUR GMAIL SETTINGS !!!
